### Daniel Edits
  * avg. streak implemented and displayed
  * power benchmarking implemented (currentStreak/avgStreak)
    * screen shake severity now proportional to power (still max/min @ user set boundaries)
    * num of particles now proportional to power (still max/min @ user set boundaries)
    * particle color saturation now proportional to power (with a floor set)
    * combo counter size now proportional to power with upper/lower bounds set to 30/120px
    * combo counter color now proportional to power
    * bar set to use same color transitions
    * added getComboCountColor() and its helper function interpolateColor to color-helper
  * max power implemented
    * when true, the counter and bar transition colors and glow
    * counter and bar have separate keyframe functions as one uses the background color/box shadow and the other uses text color/shadow
  * explosions canvas added
    * cluster of explosions occurs when the combo css transitions to neon
    * can be implemented anywhere else as well


## Minor Edits
  * particle default set to random
  * minor css changes to #streak-container
  * case for all particle color choices added

### to do:
  * refactor the avg combo bits
  * add power setting toggle in config (either fix it at 1 via setting or leave it dynamic)
  * add fade out on number and bar
  * change power/acc/benchmark to power everywhere (done?)
  * reference original author and submit pull request for the base stuff
  * clean up explosions on combo transition
  * change ludicrous kill to just ludicrous
